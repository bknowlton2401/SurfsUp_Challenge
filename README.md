# SurfsUp_Challenge

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this challenge is to review temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii during the months of June and December to determine the sustainablity of a suf and ice cream shop.  In this analysis, I was able to organize the daily averages of June and December temperatures from 2010 to 2017 and calculate the mean and standard deviation. 

## Results
The in running the analysis of daily temperature averages from 2010 to 2017, over 1500 results were calculated for the month of December and over 1700 results were calcuated for June. June returned an average daily temperature of 75 degrees (plus or minus 3.26 degrees) and December returned an average daily temperature of 71 degrees (plus or minus 3.75 degrees).
